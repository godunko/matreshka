   --  Called by the servlet container to indicate to a servlet that the
   --  servlet is being taken out of service. This method is only called once
   --  all threads within the servlet's service method have exited or after a
   --  timeout period has passed. After the servlet container calls this
   --  method, it will not call the service method again on this servlet.
   --
   --  This method gives the servlet an opportunity to clean up any resources
   --  that are being held (for example, memory, file handles, threads) and
   --  make sure that any persistent state is synchronized with the servlet's
   --  current state in memory.

   not overriding function Get_Servlet_Config
    (Self : Servlet)

   --  Returns a ServletConfig object, which contains initialization and
   --  startup parameters for this servlet. The ServletConfig object returned
   --  is the one passed to the init method.
   --
   --  Implementations of this interface are responsible for storing the
   --  ServletConfig object so that this method can return it. The
   --  GenericServlet class, which implements this interface, already does
   --  this.

   not overriding procedure Initialize

       is abstract;
   --  Called by the servlet container to indicate to a servlet that the
   --  servlet is being placed into service.
   --
   --  The servlet container calls the init method exactly once after
   --  instantiating the servlet. The init method must complete successfully
   --  before the servlet can receive any requests.
   --
   --  The servlet container cannot place the servlet into service if the init
   --  method
   --
   --   1. Throws a ServletException
   --   2. Does not return within a time period defined by the Web server
