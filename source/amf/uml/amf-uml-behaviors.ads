--  Behavior is a specification of how its context classifier changes state 
--  over time. This specification may be either a definition of possible 
--  behavior execution or emergent behavior, or a selective illustration of an 
--  interesting subset of possible executions. The latter form is typically 
--  used for capturing examples, such as a trace of a particular execution.
--  
--  A behavior owns zero or more parameter sets.
