--  A model captures a view of a physical system. It is an abstraction of the 
--  physical system, with a certain purpose. This purpose determines what is 
--  to be included in the model and what is irrelevant. Thus the model 
--  completely describes those aspects of the physical system that are 
--  relevant to the purpose of the model, at the appropriate level of detail.
