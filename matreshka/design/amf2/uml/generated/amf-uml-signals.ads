--  A signal is a specification of send request instances communicated between 
--  objects. The receiving object handles the received request instances as 
--  specified by its receptions. The data carried by a send request (which was 
--  passed to it by the send invocation occurrence that caused that request) 
--  are represented as attributes of the signal. A signal is defined 
--  independently of the classifiers handling the signal occurrence.
