--  In addition to targeting an object, invocation actions can also invoke 
--  behavioral features on ports from where the invocation requests are routed 
--  onwards on links deriving from attached connectors. Invocation actions may 
--  also be sent to a target via a given port, either on the sending object or 
--  on another object.
--  InvocationAction is an abstract class for the various actions that invoke 
--  behavior.
