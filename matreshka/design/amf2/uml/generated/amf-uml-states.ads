--  A state models a situation during which some (usually implicit) invariant 
--  condition holds.
--  The states of protocol state machines are exposed to the users of their 
--  context classifiers. A protocol state represents an exposed stable 
--  situation of its context classifier: when an instance of the classifier is 
--  not processing any operation, users of this instance can always know its 
--  state configuration.
