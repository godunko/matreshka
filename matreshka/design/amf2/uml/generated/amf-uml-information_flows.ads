--  An information flow specifies that one or more information items 
--  circulates from its sources to its targets. Information flows require some 
--  kind of information channel for transmitting information items from the 
--  source to the destination. An information channel is represented in 
--  various ways depending on the nature of its sources and targets. It may be 
--  represented by connectors, links, associations, or even dependencies. For 
--  example, if the source and destination are parts in some composite 
--  structure such as a collaboration, then the information channel is likely 
--  to be represented by a connector between them. Or, if the source and 
--  target are objects (which are a kind of instance specification), they may 
--  be represented by a link that joins the two, and so on.
