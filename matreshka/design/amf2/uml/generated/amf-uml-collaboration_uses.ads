--  A collaboration use represents one particular use of a collaboration to 
--  explain the relationships between the properties of a classifier. A 
--  collaboration use shows how the pattern described by a collaboration is 
--  applied in a given context, by binding specific entities from that context 
--  to the roles of the collaboration. Depending on the context, these 
--  entities could be structural features of a classifier, instance 
--  specifications, or even roles in some containing collaboration. There may 
--  be multiple occurrences of a given collaboration within a classifier, each 
--  involving a different set of roles and connectors. A given role or 
--  connector may be involved in multiple occurrences of the same or different 
--  collaborations. Associated dependencies map features of the collaboration 
--  type to features in the classifier. These dependencies indicate which role 
--  in the classifier plays which role in the collaboration.
