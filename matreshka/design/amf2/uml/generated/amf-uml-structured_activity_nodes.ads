--  Because of the concurrent nature of the execution of actions within and 
--  across activities, it can be difficult to guarantee the consistent access 
--  and modification of object memory. In order to avoid race conditions or 
--  other concurrency-related problems, it is sometimes necessary to isolate 
--  the effects of a group of actions from the effects of actions outside the 
--  group. This may be indicated by setting the mustIsolate attribute to true 
--  on a structured activity node. If a structured activity node is 
--  "isolated," then any object used by an action within the node cannot be 
--  accessed by any action outside the node until the structured activity node 
--  as a whole completes. Any concurrent actions that would result in 
--  accessing such objects are required to have their execution deferred until 
--  the completion of the node.
--  A structured activity node is an executable activity node that may have an 
--  expansion into subordinate nodes as an activity group. The subordinate 
--  nodes must belong to only one structured activity node, although they may 
--  be nested.
