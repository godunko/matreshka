--  A variable is considered a connectable element.
--  Variables are elements for passing data between actions indirectly. A 
--  local variable stores values shared by the actions within a structured 
--  activity group but not accessible outside it. The output of an action may 
--  be written to a variable and read for the input to a subsequent action, 
--  which is effectively an indirect data flow path. Because there is no 
--  predefined relationship between actions that read and write variables, 
--  these actions must be sequenced by control flows to prevent race 
--  conditions that may occur between actions that read or write the same 
--  variable.
