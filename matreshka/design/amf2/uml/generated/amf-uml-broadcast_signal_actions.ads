--  A broadcast signal action is an action that transmits a signal instance to 
--  all the potential target objects in the system, which may cause the firing 
--  of a state machine transitions or the execution of associated activities 
--  of a target object. The argument values are available to the execution of 
--  associated behaviors. The requestor continues execution immediately after 
--  the signals are sent out. It does not wait for receipt. Any reply messages 
--  are ignored and are not transmitted to the requestor.
