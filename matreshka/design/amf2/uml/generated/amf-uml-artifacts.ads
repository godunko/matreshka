--  An artifact is the specification of a physical piece of information that 
--  is used or produced by a software development process, or by deployment 
--  and operation of a system. Examples of artifacts include model files, 
--  source files, scripts, and binary executable files, a table in a database 
--  system, a development deliverable, or a word-processing document, a mail 
--  message.
--  An artifact is the source of a deployment to a node.
