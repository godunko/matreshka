--  A call operation action is an action that transmits an operation call 
--  request to the target object, where it may cause the invocation of 
--  associated behavior. The argument values of the action are available to 
--  the execution of the invoked behavior. If the action is marked 
--  synchronous, the execution of the call operation action waits until the 
--  execution of the invoked behavior completes and a reply transmission is 
--  returned to the caller; otherwise execution of the action is complete when 
--  the invocation of the operation is established and the execution of the 
--  invoked operation proceeds concurrently with the execution of the calling 
--  behavior. Any values returned as part of the reply transmission are put on 
--  the result output pins of the call operation action. Upon receipt of the 
--  reply transmission, execution of the call operation action is complete.
