--  A protocol transition specifies a legal transition for an operation. 
--  Transitions of protocol state machines have the following information: a 
--  pre condition (guard), on trigger, and a post condition. Every protocol 
--  transition is associated to zero or one operation (referred 
--  BehavioralFeature) that belongs to the context classifier of the protocol 
--  state machine.
