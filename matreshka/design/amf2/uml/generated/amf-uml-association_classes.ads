--  A model element that has both association and class properties. An 
--  AssociationClass can be seen as an association that also has class 
--  properties, or as a class that also has association properties. It not 
--  only connects a set of classifiers but also defines a set of features that 
--  belong to the relationship itself and not to any of the classifiers.
