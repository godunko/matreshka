--  An instance specification is a model element that represents an instance 
--  in a modeled system.
--  An instance specification has the capability of being a deployment target 
--  in a deployment relationship, in the case that it is an instance of a 
--  node. It is also has the capability of being a deployed artifact, if it is 
--  an instance of an artifact.
