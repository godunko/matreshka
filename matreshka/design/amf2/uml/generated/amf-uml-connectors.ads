--  A delegation connector is a connector that links the external contract of 
--  a component (as specified by its ports) to the realization of that 
--  behavior. It represents the forwarding of events (operation requests and 
--  events): a signal that arrives at a port that has a delegation connector 
--  to one or more parts or ports on parts will be passed on to those targets 
--  for handling. An assembly connector is a connector between two or more 
--  parts or ports on parts that defines that one or more parts provide the 
--  services that other parts use.
--  Specifies a link that enables communication between two or more instances. 
--  This link may be an instance of an association, or it may represent the 
--  possibility of the instances being able to communicate because their 
--  identities are known by virtue of being passed in as parameters, held in 
--  variables or slots, or because the communicating instances are the same 
--  instance. The link may be realized by something as simple as a pointer or 
--  by something as complex as a network connection. In contrast to 
--  associations, which specify links between any instance of the associated 
--  classifiers, connectors specify links between instances playing the 
--  connected parts only.
