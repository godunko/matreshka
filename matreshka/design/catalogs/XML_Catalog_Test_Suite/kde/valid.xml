	expectedUri="http://www.example.com/dummy">
	Test that an entity resolution with a publicId, and a
	systemId which is an URN equal to the publicId when unwrapped,
	matches the correct public entry as if only the publicId was 
	supplied.

<EntityTest type="nomatch" id="kde-valid-004" catalog="cat1.xml"

	Tests that an entity resolution with a publicId, and a systemId which 
	is an URN and not equal to the publicId when unwrapped, is reported 
	as a 'nomatch'. This dictates a certain implementation since the 
	specification leaves it open for interpretation. This approach
	is "strict", and denies invalid input, similar to how XML processing
	stops when encountering non-wellformedness.

	It is valid for a catalog to contain entries that point to the same catalog, and
	it should not be detected as circularity or any other type of error.
