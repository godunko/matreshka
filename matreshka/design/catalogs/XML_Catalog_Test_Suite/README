This is an un-official OASIS XML Catalog Test Suite, with no 
endorsement from the OASIS organization or similar.

The amount of coverage of the specification is currently undefined. Rob Lugt,
the original author, said he wrote tests what he "considered difficult". I, Frans
Englich, completed with tests in kde/ for what I ad-hoc found was missing or needed
deeper testing. If a definite indication of testing of the specification is of
interest, all dictations in the specification must be outlined and tests must exist
accordingly(and the existing ones verified).

See the TODO file in the same directory as this file for status information.

Background
----------
The majority of the work is done by Elcel Technologies, http://www.elcel.com/.
Rob Lugt, <roblugt@elcel.com>, which is the initial author, proposed to the 
Entity Resolution Technical Committee that they should endorse it, but he 
received no replies:

Three years later I, started looking for an OASIS XML Catalog Test Suite
for KDE's DOM implementation KDOM, and got in contact with Rob, who kindly donated 
the test suite to KDE. KDE's code repository is now the "home" of this test suite, 
maintained by me.
