	A slew of fixes to runTests.xsl, by Dave Pawson from xml-dev.

2005-04-14  Frans Englich <frans.englich@telia.com>
	
	Added four tests, kde-valid-008 - 011, for testing uriSuffix and
	systemSuffix, the new entries in XML Catalog 1.1, as per:

	http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/12075/xml-catalogs.html

2005-03-31  Frans Englich <frans.englich@telia.com>

	Added test kde-valid-005, for testing that entries pointing
	to the same catalog are not detected as circularities.

2005-03-31  Frans Englich <frans.englich@telia.com>

	Added tests kde-error-001, kde-error-002, kde-error-003, for testing
	circularity detection when performing delegation for uri, system and
	public.

	Since the specification allows catalog loading at lookup time, the
	circularity can emerge at isolated times, depending on type of
	lookup.

2005-03-30  Frans Englich <frans.englich@telia.com>
	
	Changed the XML format to not have the prefer attribute on UriTests
	since the prefer option is irrelevant for URI resolution.

	runTests.pl, xmlcatconf.dtd, and the test files were updated
	accordingly.

2005-03-29  Frans Englich <frans.englich@telia.com>

	* kde/valid.xml:
	* kde/cat1.xml:

	Added test cases kde-valid-005 and kde-valid-006 which 
	tests URI absolutization when performing URI resolution. ElCel has
	tests for URI absolutization of systemIds in external 
	identifier resolution.

2005-03-29  Frans Englich <frans.englich@telia.com>

	* kde/valid.xml:
	* kde/cat1.xml:

	Added two tests:

	kde-valid-003:

	Test that an entity resolution with a publicId, and a
	systemId which is an URN equal to the publicId when unwrapped, 
	matches the correct public entry as if only the publicId was 
	supplied.

	kde-valid-004:

	Tests that an entity resolution with a publicId, and a systemId which 
	is an URN and not equal to the publicId when unwrapped, is reported 
	as a 'nomatch'. This dictates a certain implementation since the 
	specification leaves it open for interpretation. This approach
	is "strict", and denies invalid input, similar to how XML processing
	stops when encountering non-wellformedness.

2005-03-29  Frans Englich <frans.englich@telia.com>

	* elcel/valid.xml:

	elcel-valid-005
2005-03-29  Frans Englich <frans.englich@telia.com>

	* runTests.pl:
	
	Fixed a bug where test cases of type 'nomatch' were not reported as
	success. I don't know if this introduces a regression for Elcel, if
	they use this tool again. However, such things are hard to avoid since
	the interfaces to the test suite aren't well defined. In either case
	can older versions be retrieved from CVS.

2005-03-28  Frans Englich <frans.englich@telia.com>

	* runTests.py:
	* runTests.xsl:

	These are alternatives to runTests.pl which is not finished but work
	in progress. The Python program outputs XML which runTests.xsl then 
	transforms to an XHTML page, with statistics and so forth. It can be 
	brought up to speed when the Test Suite becomes too large.
	
	* Makefile.am:

	Added the target "xtests" for the new test utility.

2005-03-28  Frans Englich <frans.englich@telia.com>
	
	* kde/:

	Initial commit of tests from KDE. Two were commited: testing that the
	external identifier algorithm does not continue into any nextCatalogs when 
	having done system delegation or public delegation. Elcel's test had one, 
	for URI delegation.

2005-03-28  Frans Englich <frans.englich@telia.com>

	* xmlcatconf.dtd:
	* elcel/error.xml:

	Made them validate, by fixing EntiyTest which should be UriTest, and
	adding left out attributes in the DTD.

2005-03-27  Frans Englich <frans.englich@telia.com>

	* runTests.pl:
	
	Made print strings consistent.

2005-03-20  Frans Englich <frans.englich@telia.com>

	Rob Lugt noticed an error in the license preamble, which
	was corrected in all files.

2005-03-20  Frans Englich <frans.englich@telia.com>

	* runTests.pl:
		Did various small fixes. Removed various ElCel specific parts, 
		removed a couple of Perl warnings, unified the tabbing.
	
2005-03-19  Frans Englich <frans.englich@telia.com>

	* Changlog:
	Added this Changelog file.

2005-03-16  Frans Englich <frans.englich@telia.com>

	Initial commit. The files recieved in private mail 
	from Rob Lugt(ElCel Technology) were given license headers as 
	per his instructions, and a TODO and README file was added.
