- Note, the runTests.{py,xsl} is non-functional and needs to be completed.

- It is a good idea to make a Sourceforge project out of this.

- runTests.pl is specific to ElCel. It needs to be generalized and documented, if it is to be a public Test Suite.

- Note, kdenonbeta/kdom/catalog/TestSuite/Makefile.am is specific to kdom, and should be removed if the Test Suite
	is moved to Sourceforge or similar
