  <h3 >CLDR Tailoring</h3>
  <p >As of version 1.9, CLDR is using a tailored UCA DUCET in the root locale. This is used by all other locales by default. However, there is separate collation tailoring also in root, with the keyword &ldquo;ducet&rdquo;, that tailors the modified DUCET back to the original. Using that keyword, the locale ID &ldquo;und-u-co-ducet&rdquo; allows access to the original DUCET.</p>
  <p >The root locale ordering is tailored in the following ways: </p>
  <p ><strong>Reordering of Common characters. </strong>The DUCET ordering puts characters into <em>roughly</em> the following ordering:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li >First &quot;common characters&quot;: whitespace, punctuation and general symbols, currency symbols, and numbers. </li>
    <li >Then &quot;script characters&quot;: Latin, Greek, and the rest of the scripts.</li>
  </ul>
  <p >The CLDR root locale tailored orders the common characters <em>strictly</em> by category: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>whitespace, punctuation, general symbols, currency symbols, and numbers.</li>
  </ul>
<p >The relative order within each of these groups still matches the DUCET. Symbols, punctuation, and numbers that are grouped with a particular script stay with that script. The only two exceptions are two currency symbols that are moved up to be with the other currency symbols:</p>
  <ul>
    <li >U+20A8 ( ₨ ) RUPEE SIGN</li>
    <li >U+FDFC ( ﷼ ) RIAL SIGN</li>
  </ul>
  <p >This regrouping only matters in comparison where a common character in one group is compared to a common character in another, such as if &ldquo;I♥NY&rdquo; were compared to &ldquo;I-NY&rdquo;, where a symbol is compared to a punctuation mark. What the regrouping allows is for users to parametrically reorder the groups. For example, users can reorder numbers after all scripts, or reorder Greek before Latin.</p>
  <p ><strong>Symbols non-variable. </strong>There are two options in the UCA for symbols and punctuation: <em>non-ignorable, </em>or<em> shifted</em>. With the <em>shifted</em> option, almost all symbols and punctuation are ignored -- except at a fourth level. The root locale ordering is modified so that symbols are not affected by the <em>shifted</em> option. So <em>shifted</em> only causes whitespace and punctuation to be ignored, but not symbols (like ♥). The old behavior can be specified with a locale ID using the &quot;vt&quot; keyword, to set the Variable section to include all of the symbols below it, or be set parametrically where implementations allow access. See also:</p>

    <li><a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/collation/" rel="nofollow">http://www.unicode.org/charts/collation/</a></li>
  </ul>
<p ><strong>Tailored noncharacter weights.</strong></p>
  <p >The code point U+FFFF is tailored to have a weight higher than all other characters. This allows reliable specification of a range, such as &ldquo;Sch&rdquo; ≤ X ≤ &ldquo;Sch\uFFFF&rdquo; to include all strings starting with &quot;sch&quot; or equivalent.</p>
  <p >The code point U+FFFE is tailored to have a weight lower than all other characters. This allows for <a href="http://unicode.org/reports/tr10/#Interleaved_Levels" rel="nofollow">Interleaved_Levels</a> within code point space.</p>
  <p >In CLDR, these values are not further tailorable, and nothing can tailor to them. That is, neither can occur in a collation rule: for example, the following rules are illegal:</p>
  <p ><code>&amp; \uFFFF &lt; x</code></p>
  <p ><code>&amp; x &lt;\uFFFF</code></p>
<h2 >File Formats</h2>
  <p >The file formats may change between versions of the UCA. The formats for Version 6.0 are as follows. As usual, text after a # is a comment.</p>
  <h3 >FractionalUCA_summary.txt</h3>
  <p >The lines are all comments, giving an overview of the weight structure. Lines are tab delimited, for use with spreadsheets. Most are in the format:</p>
  <p ># position fractional-weight Script General-category Codepoint Name</p>
  <p >where <em>position</em> is &quot;First&quot; or &quot;Last&quot;</p>
  <p ><em>Example</em></p>
  <p ><code># First	03 05      	Zyyy	Cc	U+0009 &lt;CHARACTER TABULATION&gt;<br>
    # Last	03 15      	Zyyy	Zp	U+2029 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR</code></p>
  <p >The topmost variable weight is marked with the following format:</p>
  <p ><code>[variable top = 0C 32 04] # END OF VARIABLE SECTION!!!</code></p>
  <p >The purpose of other lines is given by comments.</p>
  <h3 >FractionalUCA.txt</h3>
<p >The format is illustrated by the following sample lines, with commentary supplied in italics afterwards.</p>
<p ><code>[UCA version = 6.0.0]</code></p>
<p ><em>The version number</em></p>
<p ><code>0000; [,,]	# Zyyy Cc	[0000.0000.0000]	* &lt;NULL&gt;</code></p>
<p ><em>Provides a weight line. The first element (before the &quot;;&quot;) is a hex codepoint sequence. The second field is a sequence of collation elements. Each collation element has 3 parts separated by commas: the primary weight, secondary weight, and tertiary weight. A weight is either empty (meaning a zero or ignorable weight) or is a sequence of one or more bytes. The bytes are interpreted as a &quot;fraction&quot;, meaning that the ordering is 04 &lt; 05 05 &lt; 06. The weights are constructed so that no weight is an initial subsequence of another: that is, having both the weights 05 and 05 05 is illegal. The above line consists of all ignorable weights.</em><br>

<p ><em>Single-byte weights are given to particularly frequent characters, such as space, digits, and a-z.

<p ><em>There are special values assigned to code point sequences FDD0+X. These sequences are simply used to communicate special values, and can be eliminated.

<h3 >allkeys_CLDR.txt</h3>
<p >A reordering of the DUCET allkeys file for CLDR which guarantees that characters with weights less than the Latin letter 'a' are in the order: <em>spaces, punctuation, general-symbols, currency-symbols, </em>and<em> numbers.</em> (Here, <em>general-symbols</em> includes anything else in the DUCET with weights less than the Latin letter 'a', thus including somecharacters with the General_Category <code>Lm</code>.) This tailoring also sets only spaces and punctuation to be variable. Unlike allkeys.txt, the ordering is by non-ignorable sort order, and the primary values may overlap with secondaries; if non-overlap is required in the implementation, non-zero primaries should be offset by an appropriate amount. Because of the preprocessing, some values may have somewhat different weights, but the results (other than the above changes) should be the same.</p>
<p >The format is similar to that of allkeys.txt, although there may be some differences in whitespace.</p>
<h3 >UCA_Rules.txt</h3>
<p >The format uses the CLDR &quot;short&quot; format for collation tailoring. Here is an illustration of the format:</p>
<p ><code>&lt;	 𝍱	# 5.0 [No] [1499.0020.0002] U+1D371 COUNTING ROD TENS DIGIT NINE<br>
  &lt;	 0	# 1.1 [Nd] [149A.0020.0002] U+0030 DIGIT ZERO</code><br>
  <em>The ASCII ZERO is primary-greater than </em>U+1D371 COUNTING ROD TENS DIGIT</p>
<p ><code>&lt;&lt;&lt;	 ０	# 1.1 [Nd] [149A.0020.0003] U+FF10 FULLWIDTH DIGIT ZERO</code><br>
  <em>The fullwidth ZERO is tertiary-after the ASCII ZERO.</em></p>

    <em>The U+1F101 DIGIT ZERO COMMA is tertiary-greater than the fullwidth ZERO followed by U+002C (comma)</em><br>
  <br>
  <code>=	 𝟘	# 3.1 [Nd] [149A.0020.0005] U+1D7D8 MATHEMATICAL DOUBLE-STRUCK DIGIT ZERO</code><br>
  <em>The 05] U+1D7D8 MATHEMATICAL DOUBLE-STRUCK DIGIT ZERO is primary, secondary, and tertiary equal to U+1F101 DIGIT ZERO COMMA</em></p>
