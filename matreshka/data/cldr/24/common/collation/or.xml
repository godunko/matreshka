			#	The following tailoring is an adjustment of the
			#	DUCET collation order for CANDRABINDU, ANUSVARA,
			#	and VISARGA. Instead of being sorted with secondary
			#	weights, they are collated on primary level between
			#	the independent vowels and the consonants.
			# 
				&ଔ<ଁ<ଂ<ଃ
			# KSSA is sorted after HA.
				&ହ<କ୍ଷ
			# YYA is secondary different from YA.
