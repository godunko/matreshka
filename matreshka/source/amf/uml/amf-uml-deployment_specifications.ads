--  A deployment specification specifies a set of properties that determine 
--  execution parameters of a component artifact that is deployed on a node. A 
--  deployment specification can be aimed at a specific type of container. An 
--  artifact that reifies or implements deployment specification properties is 
--  a deployment descriptor.
