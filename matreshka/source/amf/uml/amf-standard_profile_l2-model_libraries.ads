--  A package that contains model elements that are intended to be reused by 
--  other packages. Model libraries are frequently used in conjunction with 
--  applied profiles. This is expressed by defining a dependency between a 
--  profile and a model library package, or by defining a model library as 
--  contained in a profile package. The classes in a model library are not 
--  stereotypes and tagged definitions extending the metamodel. A model 
--  library is analogous to a class library in some programming languages. 
--  When a model library is defined as a part of a profile, it is imported or 
--  deleted with the application or removal of the profile. The profile is 
--  implicitly applied to its model library. In the other case, when the model 
--  library is defined as an external package imported by a profile, the 
--  profile requires that the model library be there in the model at the stage 
--  of the profile application. The application or the removal of the profile 
--  does not affect the presence of the model library elements.
