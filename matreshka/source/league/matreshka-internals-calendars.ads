   --  Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) representation from the X/Open DCE Time
   --  Service is used as internal representation. It is defined as follows:
   --
   --     Time units          100 nanoseconds (10-7 seconds)
   --
   --     Base time           15 October 1582 00:00:00.
   --
   --     Approximate range   AD 30,000
   --
   --  UTC time in this implementation always refers to time in Greenwich Time
   --  Zone.
   --
   --  The corresponding internal representations of relative time is the same
   --  one as for absolute time, and hence with similar characteristics:
   --
   --     Time units          100 nanoseconds (10-7 seconds)
   --
   --     Approximate range   +/- 30,000 years

   type X_Open_Time is new Interfaces.Integer_64;
