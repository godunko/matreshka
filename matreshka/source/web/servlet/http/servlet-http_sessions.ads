--  Provides a way to identify a user across more than one page request or
--  visit to a Web site and to store information about that user.
--
--  The servlet container uses this interface to create a session between an
--  HTTP client and an HTTP server. The session persists for a specified time
--  period, across more than one connection or page request from the user. A
--  session usually corresponds to one user, who may visit a site many times.
--  The server can maintain a session in many ways such as using cookies or
--  rewriting URLs.
--
--  This interface allows servlets to
--
--    1. View and manipulate information about a session, such as the session
--       identifier, creation time, and last accessed time
--    2. Bind objects to sessions, allowing user information to persist across
--       multiple user connections 
--
--  When an application stores an object in or removes an object from a
--  session, the session checks whether the object implements
--  HttpSessionBindingListener. If it does, the servlet notifies the object
--  that it has been bound to or unbound from the session. Notifications are
--  sent after the binding methods complete. For session that are invalidated
--  or expire, notifications are sent after the session has been invalidated or
--  expired.
--
--  When container migrates a session between VMs in a distributed container
--  setting, all session attributes implementing the
--  HttpSessionActivationListener interface are notified.
--
--  A servlet should be able to handle cases in which the client does not
--  choose to join a session, such as when cookies are intentionally turned
--  off. Until the client joins the session, isNew returns true. If the client
--  chooses not to join the session, getSession will return a different session
--  on each request, and isNew will always return true.
--
--  Session information is scoped only to the current web application
--  (ServletContext), so information stored in one context will not be directly
--  visible in another.
