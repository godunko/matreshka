--  Defines an object to assist a servlet in sending a response to the client.
--  The servlet container creates a ServletResponse object and passes it as an
--  argument to the servlet's service method.
--
--  To send binary data in a MIME body response, use the ServletOutputStream
--  returned by getOutputStream().
--
--  The charset for the MIME body response can be specified explicitly using
--  the setCharacterEncoding(java.lang.String) and
--  setContentType(java.lang.String) methods, or implicitly using the
--  setLocale(java.util.Locale) method. Explicit specifications take precedence
--  over implicit specifications. If no charset is specified, ISO-8859-1 will
--  be used. The setCharacterEncoding, setContentType, or setLocale method must
--  be called before getWriter and before committing the response for the
--  character encoding to be used.
--
--  See the Internet RFCs such as RFC 2045 for more information on MIME.
--  Protocols such as SMTP and HTTP define profiles of MIME, and those
--  standards are still evolving.

   --  setContentType(java.lang.String) with the String of text/html and

   --  setContentType with the String of text/html; charset=UTF-8.
   --
   --  This method can be called repeatedly to change the character encoding.
   --  This method has no effect if it is called after getWriter has been

   --  Containers must communicate the character encoding used for the servlet
   --  response's writer to the client if the protocol provides a way for doing
   --  so. In the case of HTTP, the character encoding is communicated as part
   --  of the Content-Type header for text media types. Note that the character
   --  encoding cannot be communicated via HTTP headers if the servlet does not
   --  specify a content type; however, it is still used to encode text written
   --  via the servlet response's writer.

   --  text/html;charset=UTF-8. The response's character encoding is only set
   --  from the given content type if this method is called before getWriter is
   --  called.
   --
   --  This method may be called repeatedly to change content type and
   --  character encoding. This method has no effect if called after the
   --  response has been committed. It does not set the response's character
   --  encoding if it is called after getWriter has been called or after the
   --  response has been committed.

   --  Containers must communicate the content type and the character encoding
   --  used for the servlet response's writer to the client if the protocol
